# Skin-Consultation-Centre

The Skin Consultation Centre Management System is a program implemented in Java using OOP concepts that allows the manager to manage doctors, book consultations, and perform various management tasks related to the consultation center.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a program that implements a system for managing a Skin Consultation Centre. The system consists of a console-based interface and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better user interaction.

- **Console Menu Implementation:** The WestminsterSkinConsultationManager class provides a console menu interface for various management actions. These actions include adding a new doctor, deleting a doctor, printing the list of doctors, and saving the information to a file for persistence.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Implementation:** A GUI is implemented to enhance the user experience. The GUI allows users to visualize the list of doctors, sort them alphabetically, and book consultations with specific doctors. The GUI also provides functionality for capturing patient information, entering consultation cost, adding notes (encrypted), and displaying stored information.
